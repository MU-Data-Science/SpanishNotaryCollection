# Model Usage Guideline
This will walk you through the steps to use the model and tokenizer that we have provided.

# Masked Language Model


1. **Download the Model Files**:

   Download the fine-tuned model's weights and tokenizer configuration files. Ensure that you have the following files:
   - `config.json`: Configuration file for the tokenizer and model.
   - `pytorch_model.bin`: Pretrained model weights file.
   - `special_tokens_map.json` (optional): File containing special tokens mapping if applicable.

2. **Instantiate the Tokenizer and Model**:

   In your Python script or notebook, import the required modules and instantiate the tokenizer and model using the downloaded files:

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
   
   # Replace 'path_to_model_directory' with the path where you downloaded the model files.
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('path_to_model_directory')
   model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('path_to_model_directory')

2. **Feed Tokenizer Input to the Model**:

    ```python
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**tokenizer_input)
